## What this does
This code is meant to notify you of new titles released today that you are currently following. It reads off of a txt file with your current reading list and sends emails when a title is released that is on your list. I have not incorporated a feature that allows it to run at a specific time every day. If you want to do this, just search it up on google lmao. 

## How to use
1. Download repository.
2. Change gmail.txt by adding your gmail, key, and recipients list.
3. If you don't know your key, go to mygoogleaccount.com. Make sure you have 2-factor authentication enabled. At the top search "app passwords" and add an app password.
4. Add titles you want to keep track of in list.txt. Make sure to capitalize it like the website does, include punctuation, and don't add chapter numbers.
5. Run main.exe in and hopefully it works.
6. If you want to run it on a regular basis, go search up a guide online on how to run exe's periodically.
